1. **EXERCISE.**
  1. **Method of Exercise**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Warrant, Holder may exercise this Warrant, at any time or from time to time, on any Business Day on or after the date the Tokens are generated and available for issuance and delivery (the &quot;_ **Token Launch** _&quot;) and before the Expiration Date, for Holder&#39;s Portion. This Warrant may be exercised any number of times by Holder, prior to the Expiration Date, to provide Holder the opportunity to purchase up to Holder&#39;s Portion at each applicable Token Launch, less any Tokens purchased by Holder pursuant to any prior exercise of this Warrant with respect to such Tokens. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any increase in the Total Network Tokens following a Token Launch, (i) Holder&#39;s Portion with respect to such Tokens shall be recalculated to take into account such increase. This Warrant shall be exercised by submitting a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as Exhibit 1, duly executed by Holder, and by payment in a form specified in Section 2.2 hereof of an amount equal to the Warrant Exercise Price or, if applicable, an election to net exercise this Warrant as provided in Section 2.5 hereof for the number of Tokens to be acquired in connection with such exercise.
  2. **Form of Payment**. Payment for Holder&#39;s Portion of Tokens upon each exercise may be made by (a) a check payable to the Company&#39;s order, (b) wire transfer of funds to the Company, (c) cancellation of indebtedness of the Company to Holder, (d) by net exercise as provided in Section 2.5 hereof, (e) any other method of payment approved by the Company, or (f) any combination of the foregoing.
  3. **Delivery of Tokens**. In connection with each exercise pursuant to this Section 2, the Holder will provide to the Company with a network address to allocate Holder&#39;s Tokens to upon such exercise (or otherwise upon the applicable date of delivery, as described herein), and the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, such Tokens to such network address, subject to the requirements of Section 3.2, and delivery and release pursuant thereto. The Company shall be entitled to assume the validity of any network address provided by a Holder and has no duty to verify such network address. Holder may update such network address by providing written notice in accordance with Section 7.5; provided, that the Company need not consider such updated network address to be valid until the Company has confirmed receipt of such notice and has approved such updated network address.
  4. **Restrictions on Exercise**. This Warrant may not be exercised if the issuance of the Tokens upon such exercise would constitute a violation of any applicable federal or state laws or other regulations, as determined by the Board of Directors on the advice of counsel. As a condition to each exercise of this Warrant, Holder shall execute a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as Exhibit 1, confirming and acknowledging that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 6 of this Warrant as they apply to Holder are true and complete as of the date of exercise. In the event that legal counsel to the Company advises the Company that it is necessary or advisable for regulatory reasons, Holder shall also be required to deliver, as a condition to exercise, an accredited investor verification letter from a qualified third party verifying that Holder is an &quot;accredited investor&quot; within the meaning of Rule 501 of the Securities Act (as defined above). The Holder acknowledges that the Company is not obligated, and the Company has not made any determination, to launch a Protocol or generate Tokens.
  5. **Net Exercise Election**.

1. Upon each exercise of this Warrant and subject to the restrictions provided in Section 3.2 hereof, Holder may elect to make such exercise without the payment by Holder of any additional consideration, by submitting a copy of the exercise notice attached hereto as Exhibit 1 with the net exercise election selected, duly executed by Holder, for the number of Tokens that is obtained under the following formula:

X = Y – (A ÷ B)

where X = the number of Tokens to be issued to Holder pursuant to a net exercise of this Warrant effected pursuant to this Section 2.5.

Y = the number of Tokens equal to the portion of Holder&#39;s Portion remaining to be exercised.

A = the Warrant Exercise Price.

B = the fair market value of one Token, determined at the time of such net exercise as set forth in Section 2.5(b).

1. The Company will promptly respond in writing to an inquiry by Holder as to the then current fair market value of one Token. For purposes of the calculation in Section 2.5(a), the fair market value of one Token shall be determined by the Company&#39;s Board of Directors in good faith.

  1. **Notice of Expiration**. In the event that a Token Launch has occurred, then the Company shall provide notice to Holder no later than 30 days prior to the Expiration Date, which notice shall specify all Tokens that have been issued by a Token Issuer to such Holder during the term of the Warrant and the maximum number of Total Network Tokens issuable under this Warrant to such Holder.
1. **ISSUANCE OF TOKENS.**
  1. **Date of Issuance**. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised with respect to Holder immediately prior to the close of business on the date that it is exercised pursuant to the terms of Section 2 above by Holder, and the Person entitled to receive the Tokens issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all purposes as the holder of record of such Tokens as of the close of business on such date. As soon as practicable on or after such date, and in any event within two (2) Business Days following such date of exercise, the Company shall issue and deliver, or cause to be issued and delivered, to the Person or Persons entitled to receive the same the Tokens issuable upon such exercise.
  2. **Restrictions on Tokens**. Any Tokens issued hereunder will be subject to such restrictions on transferability as required by applicable laws and regulations as determined by the Company&#39;s Board of Directors and as set forth in Section 3.3 hereto; provided, however, that such restrictions shall be no more stringent than those applicable to Tokens owned by or allocated to any Insider and shall be adjusted, as applicable, to accelerate or otherwise align with any such less stringent restrictions. In addition, any such restrictive provisions shall provide that any discretionary waiver or termination of the restrictions of such agreements that are approved by the Company&#39;s Board of Directors with respect to any Insider shall apply to Holder, pro rata, based on the number of Tokens held by such parties. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, even for Tokens that are subject to restrictions on transferability, Holder may exercise the voting and other governance rights linked to the Tokens or deploy them towards staking in accordance with the governance and other rules of the Protocol.
  3. **Transfer Restrictions; Lockup Period**. All Tokens distributed to or received by Holder pursuant hereto shall be subject to a mandatory Lockup Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the Lockup Period and Transfer Restrictions shall not apply to any Tokens received by any Holder as a reward for staking Tokens on the Protocol or any network or protocol pursuant to the proof-of-stake protocol included in the Protocol. During the period beginning on the date of the Token Launch and ending on the four-year anniversary of such date (the &quot;_ **Lockup Period** _&quot;), Holder shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company, Transfer any Tokens except to the extent such Tokens have become unlocked, as follows:

    2. during the twelve months following the Cliff, 1/12th of 25% of the total number of the Tokens of Holder shall become unlocked on each monthly anniversary of the Cliff;
    3. during the twelve months following the end-date of the period described in the immediately preceding clause &quot;(b)&quot;, 1/12th of 25% of the total number of the Tokens of Holder shall become unlocked on each monthly anniversary of such end-date; and

For the avoidance of doubt, any Tokens issued upon exercise of this Warrant and subject to the Lockup Period will be delivered immediately upon exercise to Holder and held by Holder for its own account.

If Holder Transfers any Token in contravention of this Section 3.3 (such Tokens &quot;Transferred Tokens&quot;), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, Holder shall promptly (and, in any event, within five (5) days thereof) deliver and surrender to the Company a number of Tokens equal to the number of Transferred Tokens.

  1. **Reservation of Tokens**. The Company shall reserve, or cause to be reserved, for the benefit of the Holder, and not distribute, sell or encumber, or cause to be not distributed, sold or encumbered, the maximum number of Tokens issuable under this Warrant until the earlier to occur of (x) the date that this Warrant is fully exercised or (y) the Expiration Date.
